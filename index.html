      <!-- Too many scripts loading at the same time in one file expecially if not all are needed is not great for performance basically
      we should split our codes into modules and then compile the different js into one js and we can still use our former code -->

      <!-- scripts -->

      <!-- <script src="mysite.com/script-1.js"></script>
      <script src="mysite.com/script-2.js"></script>
      <script src="mysite.com/script-3.js"></script>

<!-- WEBPACK

  Webpack takes all of our assets and outputs them to a production-ready bundle

   - Bundles JavaScript files into one file, minimizing http requests
   - Process SASS / LESS files into CSS and only use them where needed
   - Convert JSX or ES2015 into vanilla JS which browsers understand
